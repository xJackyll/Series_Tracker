# Series Tracker

Series Tracker is a Python script with a graphical interface that helps you keep track of your progress in a series. It is specifically designed to work with the site [AnimeSaturn](https://www.animesaturn.tv). While the code may not be perfect and there could be some bugs, the script is functional and provides a useful tool for series enthusiasts.

## Prerequisites

Before using Series Tracker, make sure you have the following:

1. **Selenium**: Install Selenium by following the instructions [here](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/index.html).

2. **Chromedriver**: Ensure you have the correct version of Chromedriver installed. For more details, visit [Chromedriver Downloads](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads).

3. **Configuration**: Modify the variables at the beginning of the script, focusing on the Chrome User Profile Path.

## Usage

Follow these steps to use Series Tracker effectively:

1. Install Selenium and Chromedriver as mentioned in the prerequisites.

2. Update the variables at the beginning of the script, focusing on the Chrome User Profile Path.

3. Launch the script.

4. Use the relevant box to submit the name of the TV show. Note that changes take effect only after reopening the script (the episode resets to 1).

5. Changes to the episode apply immediately.

6. Keep in mind that the GUI may freeze as long as the Chrome page remains open.

7. To enhance your experience, it's recommended to use an ad blocker due to the site's numerous ad redirects.

## Disclaimer

The code may not be well-written, and there might be some bugs. However, the script is functional and serves its purpose. Use it at your own discretion.
