# Series_Tracker
I made a project that has a graphical interface and stores where you got to in a series
This script is only designed to work with the site https://www.animesaturn.tv
The code is not well written and it's also a little buggy. However it works and it's very useful.
In order to work you have to do 3 things:
1) Install Selenium (see more at https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/index.html)
2) Have the right Chromedriver version (see more at https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)
3) Change the variables at the beginning of the file (mostly the Chrome User Profile Path ) 

Tips:
- If you want to change the Tv Show submit the name in the relevant box. The change apply only after reopening the script (the Ep resets to 1)
- Changes to the episode apply immediately
- GUI freezes for as long as the chrome page remains open
- I highly recommend using an ad blocker because the site has a large number of ad redirects.
