Series Tracker
Series Tracker is a Python script with a graphical interface that helps you keep track of your progress in a series. It is specifically designed to work with the site AnimeSaturn. While the code may not be perfect and there could be some bugs, the script is functional and provides a useful tool for series enthusiasts.

Prerequisites

Selenium: Install Selenium by following the instructions here.

Chromedriver: Ensure you have the correct version of Chromedriver installed. For more details, visit Chromedriver Downloads.

Configuration: Modify the variables at the beginning of the script, focusing on the Chrome User Profile Path.

Usage
Follow these steps to use Series Tracker effectively:

Launch the script.

Use the relevant box to submit the name of the TV show. Note that changes take effect only after reopening the script (the episode resets to 1).
